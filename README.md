# Plant-Disease-Recognition-System
 The Plant Disease Prediction project involves developing a machine learning model to detect  and predict plant diseases from images of leaves. The system uses image processing  techniques and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to classify plant diseases based on  symptoms visible on the foliage.
